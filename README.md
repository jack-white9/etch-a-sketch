# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch is a web-based JavaScript app where the user can draw on a grid canvas using their cursor. The webpage detects cursor hovering and uses this to transform elements on the page, allowing the user to create any image they want. Other functionalities include the ability to show/hide gridlines, clearing the canvas, and adjusting the grid size to enable more detailed sketches.
